# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1^2 +2^2 +...+10^2 =385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1+2+...+10)^2 =55^2 =3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
